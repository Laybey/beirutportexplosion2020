        <center><p>Social networks are an interactive arena with numerous chances to communicate and discuss the most relevant political, economic, social, and other themes. An ammonium nitrate explosion occurred at the port of Beirut on August 4, 2020, with detonations felt throughout the country. The world's media outlets start to share information and news about the explosion live and in real time through social networks like Twitter. This includes the first information about what caused the tragedy, how the situation is changing, such as the number of victims or the state of play, and how people around the world are reacting to the tragic event. We assume that while Lebanese media drifted the attention from the blast, western media had been more consistent towards holding the government or particular parties accountable. Our research question is as follows; How has the Beirut port explosion been perceived by the US in comparison to Lebanese media over time?</p></center>

           <center><p style="color: white; font-weight:600; font-size: 2rem; line-height: 1.1;">Through media cloud and network mapping, we will compare the western and eastern reactions to the Beirut port explosion over time. Three Minet scrape commands were implemented for our research. These commands gathered Tweets that contained the phrase "Beirut port explosion." In Cortext, we have compiled the hashtags used in these Tweets as well as their relative like counts. To trace the differences across time, we selected three distinct one-month time periods. For the first, we selected August 3, 2020, one day prior to the explosion, till September 3, 2020. The subsequent one occurred exactly one year later, and the final one occurred one year after that. To ensure visibility, we decreased the number of nodes per map to 50. We elected not to implement manual bins for the like count, opting instead to let the machine build homogeneous bins, which resulted in two bins per map in each case: one containing Tweets with zero likes and the other containing Tweets with more than zero likes</p></center>

Our primary observation, figure , was extracted through media cloud, by selecting 5 news outlets from the Middle East, notably MTV Lebanon, LBCI, Al Jazeera, Al Jadeed, and Lorient Le Jour, and 5 other from the Western media, such as, CNN, The daily star,  BBC News, New York Times, and the Guardian. While orange represents Lebanese media and in blue US media, 74% of Lebanese media outlets were the first to report and discuss the explosion immediately following the occurrence, compared to only 1% of U.S. media outlets. This could be seen as the local media having the most access to incident-related information and images. 
Around 01/21, the Lebanese media decreased its coverage of the events, but U.S. media coverage climbed to 2% when the media began discussing the punishment of the political parties participating in the dramatic event, due to corruption and media restriction in Lebanon.
From February to June 2020, U.S. media coverage of the port explosion increased while Lebanese media coverage decreased. During this time, on May 15, 2020, Lebanon held general elections, therefore, the media focused more on the election campaign and less on the explosion.

The second element we wanted to test, was the like counts in relation to the number of tweets, to try to understand the reach and attention the port explosion had gotten, and whether or not that had increased over the years. Figure 2 shows the dramatic drop between year 1 and 2, with not that significant reach in year 1 initially.

This network map emphasizes on prayer and other broad exclamations, such as #beirutinourhearts and #prayforlebanon, according to the network map. This may be indicative of a feeling of helplessness and bewilderment. People do not yet know what had occurred or who may be responsible for the attack. The mention of Hezbollah and Israel indicates, on the other hand, that a search for potential criminals is already underway and that conspiracy theories have already emerged. Numerous additional nations have also been mentioned, typically for a particular cause. Cyprus, for instance, was one of the countries where the explosion was also audible, which must have been extremely shocking to Europeans given that the island is already a member of the EU. As a former colonial power, France has substantial civil society links with Lebanon.

                    Individual leaders, such as Hassan Nasrallah, general secretary of Hezbollah, and Hassan Diab, prime minister at the time of the explosion, are now prominently featured for the year 2021, although they were not previously. As the causes of the explosion become clearer, this indicates that the search for criminals has become more focused. This is also due to the publication of a Human Rights Watch investigation on the causes of the explosion, which blames "mismanagement and corruption by the Lebanese government." Therefore, the general prayers of the previous year have given way to cries for human rights and justice. Israel and France are remarkable in that they continue to be mentioned. Israel continues to be implicated by some as the culprit of the explosion, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim and HRW's study blames government negligence instead. On the commemoration of the explosion, France, and other continues to be involved in the aid process by arranging another donor conference.

                    This year, there appears to be a particular emphasis on the date of the explosion (4 August), which is noted in numerous hashtag variations. This may indicate that the day has become a memorial and day of mourning for the deceased. Other hashtags emphasize justice and accountability, and Tarek Bitar, the lead investigating judge, is also addressed. Again, this might be viewed as a symptom of the people's impotence in the face of an unchanging political system. No basic precautions were made to prevent a similar disaster from occurring.

                    Figure 6 represents the engagement among frontliners and donors. The actors involved were many & diverse, where local, like INJAZ Lebanon, Truth be Told and Live Love Beirut, and international organizations, such as UNESCO and different UN bodies, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, The European Union were present, as well as embassies, notably the US and Qatar fund. News outlets were very prominent, as they were serving as frontline reporters and were ones to have direct communication with the donors and international organizations. No sight of the Lebanese government was present, which highly depicts the lack of trust both, the Lebanese people and the International community have towards it.

                <p style="color: white; font-weight:600; font-size: 2rem; line-height: 2;">Our small sample size was the first barrier that arose during our research. To augment it, we decided to use the phrase "Beirut port explosion" instead of the hashtag #Beirutportexplosion, which was our original plan. As a result, several of the hashtags that appeared on our network maps were irrelevant, such as #scarboroughagincourt, which turned out to be a Toronto church congregation praying for the victims of the Beirut port explosion. Additional study could filter out the majority of irrelevant hashtags. Another significant limitation included the fact that Middle Eastern media do not use as many hashtags, and mainly cite facts in Arabic, and for the general public, many write in Arabic while using the Roman alphabet. </p></center>
